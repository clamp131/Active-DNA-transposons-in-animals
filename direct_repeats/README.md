# Direct repeats annotation

The `FindRepeat.pl` script detects repeated k-mers in the transposon end sequences.

```
Usage:

  perl FindRepeat.pl <k> <right> <left>

  <k>       length of the repeat (k-mer size)
  <right>   sequence of the right end, in two-line fasta format
  <left>    sequence of the left end, in two-line fasta format

  Note that the fasta header format must be <TE name>-{L,R}

Output format:

  column 1: TE name
  column 2: repeat count
  column 3: repeat seqence
  column 4: position in left boundary sequence
  column 5: position in right boundary sequence
            (reverse complemented)
```

An input example is provided in this folder, and result can be generated by:

```bash
perl FindRepeat.pl 5 known-hAT-R known-hAT-L
