# Direct repeats annotation

The `FindRepeat.pl` script detects repeated k-mers in the transposon end sequences.

```
Usage:

  perl FindRepeat.pl <k> <right> <left>

  <k>       length of the repeat (k-mer size)
  <right>   sequence of the right end, in two-line fasta format
  <left>    sequence of the left end, in two-line fasta format

  Note that the fasta header format must be <TE name>-{L,R}

Output format:

  column 1: TE name
  column 2: repeat count
  column 3: repeat seqence
  column 4: position in left boundary sequence
  column 5: position in right boundary sequence
            (reverse complemented)
```

`candidates_LTF.fas` and `candidates_RTF.fas` contains the non-coding sequences of the 130 TE candidates, and prediction results were generated by

```bash
for k in 5 6 7 8 9 10; do
  perl FindRepeat.pl ${k} candidates_RTF.fas candidates_LTF.fas > predicted_${k}.tsv
done
```
