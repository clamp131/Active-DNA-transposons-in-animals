# Scripts to analyze the evolutionary modes of MITEs

1. Prepare the TE info file 'TE_list', the repeatmasker output files generated by extract_TE.pl (e.g., 1.rm for hAT-2_AG), and the files containing TE copies with perferct TSDs generated by filter_TSD.pl (e.g., 1.filter.fas) in folder TIR_TSD_prediction.

2. perl extract_mite.pl: It will output three files, e.g., 1_1.mite, 1_2.mite and 1_3.mite. The first two are used for dot plot, and the last one is for alignment.

3. Dotplot in R of the internal breakpoints of MITEs against the consensus TEs.

   pdf("1.pdf")
   
   dat1=read.table("1_1.mite")
   
   names(dat1)=c("order","pos","div")
   
   dat2=read.table("1_2.mite")
   
   names(dat2)=c("order","pos","div")
   
   p1=ggplot(dat1,aes(x=pos,y=order))+geom_point()
   
   p2=ggplot(dat2,aes(x=pos,y=order))+geom_point()
   
   plot_grid(p1,p2,ncol=1)
   
   dev.off()

5. perl breakpoint_summary.pl: list the conserved MITEs which are defined as those with conserved (at least three copies) breakpoints.

6. perl extract_internal_seq.pl: MITEs may contain sequences unrelated to consensus TEs. This script is used to extract these sequences for alignment by mafft.
